# Module 3:  Apply Policy to Shopify API: Overview

### Briefing

In these labs you will **configure policies and SLAs** that will allow you to manage security, quality of service to the **Shopify API**. In addition, you will **monitor your API through API analytics**.

We will proxy an existing API in Lab 1 and You can:

*   [Manage security](https://docs.mulesoft.com/api-manager/2.x/latest-overview-concept) and enforce [policies](https://docs.mulesoft.com/api-manager/2.x/policies-landing-page)
*   Manage [contracts](https://docs.mulesoft.com/api-manager/2.x/defining-sla-tiers) associated with that API
*   [Monitor the API](https://docs.mulesoft.com/api-manager/2.x/analytics-landing-page) with analytics and KPI metrics in a dashboard view

This makes it easy for the **API manager** to understand how the API is performing, how it’s being used and by whom, and for the API Administrator to identify potential issues before they arise.

The 1 lab in this unit is:
