# Module 1: The Modern API - Design: Lab 1

### Lab 1: Search for an API in Exchange

#### Overview

API’s are the reusable assets that simplify and accelerate the creation of modern software applications. As a Mulesoft developer you will need to consume API’s created by other members of the organization and publish new API’s for others to consume. This new consumption model is the foundation of a new approach for delivering software solutions where API’s form the building blocks of the modern enterprise.

This first lab will focus on using **Anypoint Exchange** to search for API’s and other assets published in the private exchange.
