### Briefing

You have completed the design of the Shopify API and now you are ready to implement it. In this module, we will create the implementation of our API that will process the REST requests.

The Module is separated into three different labs.

*   [Lab 1: Create Shopify Project from API Specification](/module2-lab1.md)
*   [Lab 2: Implement the Shopify API in Studio](/module2-lab2.md)
*   [Lab 3: Deploy the Shopify API Implementation](/module2-lab3.md)

To test the connectivity to the NTO Shopify shopping cart we will be testing a single use case of retrieving all Shopify orders. Since sourcing consumer orders from Shopify is critical for NTO’s DTC goals we will make sure that works.   
  
We will leverage the [https://nto-demo.com/](https://nto-demo.com/) Shopify site to do just this.

This module will feature low code connectivity via what we call “**connectors”.** Today Anypoint Studio has over 200 system specific connectors (e.g. Salesforce, Shopify, SAP, etc.) that makes connecting to some of our main source systems easy. Since NTO is using Shopify, we will be getting very familiar with the **Shopify Connector.**
